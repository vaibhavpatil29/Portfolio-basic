#How to Use:-
1)To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

2)Download or Clone the Repository:

3)Download the project files (index.html, style.css, and the images folder) and place them in a single folder on your computer.

4)Customize the Content:

5)Open index.html in a text editor.

6)Replace the placeholder text (name, title, contact details, etc.) with your own information.

7)Replace profile.jpg in the root folder with your own profile picture (ensure the filename matches or update the src attribute in the <img> tag).

#Technologies Used:-
1)HTML5: For the structure and content of the webpage.

2)CSS3: For custom styling, including the background gradient and hover effects.

3)Bootstrap 5: A popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. It handles the grid, navbar, and core styling.

#Customization:-
1)Background Gradient: To change the background, open style.css and modify the background property in the .body-gradient class.

2)Theme Colors: Most theme colors (like the blue for headings) are controlled by Bootstrap's utility classes (e.g., text-primary). You can change these directly in the index.html file.
